</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In the spirit of this blog being as much for myself as it is for you, dear reader,
I thought the end of August would be the perfect time to give myself an update
of my summer, and also catalogue the aspirations I have for the year to come.</p>
<p>So, here that is.</p>
<h1>Co-op as a Research Assistant (and almost a full-time student)</h1>
<p>I'd be lying if I said I didn't find this summer to be challenging from a work
perspective. Towards the second half of it, I felt myself getting overwhelmed
by work.
I was worried that I wasn't getting as much work done as I should have been,
which got me stressed out, which made it even harder to get things
done at the pace I wanted.</p>
<p>I think a bunch of things conspired to make me feel like I underperformed.
The most important seem to have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having shorter working hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Needing to juggle work and classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quite unstructured work environment of academic research</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being honest with myself, I was probably doing about 75% of the
work I'd normally get done in a 40-hour work week. Considering I was only working
75% of a 40-hour work week, this should be totally reasonable.
I think this highlights a problem I have about managing expectations.
I had high aspirations for what I would be able to accomplish during my work
term, but I was also taking three university courses. I should have realized that
even the most hard working person would find it hard to keep up that kind of
schedule. I don't think there's any specific remedy for this, other than to
give myself credit where credit is due, and try to avoid overloading myself
in the future.
Either way, I'm happy I came out of this summer with my work more or less finished
and no classes failed. It's all about the little victories.</p>
<p>And definitely, doing research is just hard. This is the first situation
I've been in where my goal was just to explore the data and document what I found.
I was a little overwhelmed by choice, constantly trying to test my assumptions
- is my data heteroskedastic? Should I include interaction terms?
Should I come up with more variables to include in the model?
Trying to figure out which questions were relevant was difficult, and I think
it's the kind of thing you just need practice at before being comfortable with.
Hopefully, my schedule will allow me to do more of that kind of free-form research
and data analysis.</p>
<p>Speaking of which...</p>
<h1>Economics and Statistics, Oh My!</h1>
<p>The exciting news for myself this coming year is that I'm finally planning on
graduating! (For those readers not in the loop, my previous plan was to graduate
in 2019 - 7 years after starting university in 2012.) At the suggestion of
the undergraduate administrator in the University of Toronto's Economics Department,
I am adding a minor in statistics to my studies. This means I have the opportunity
to get a solid background in probability theory and statistical modelling!</p>
<p>I've seen myself get more and more into all aspects of statistics since getting a
generous 55% in an introductory probability course.
Obviously, statistics forms a core part of economics, and an absolutely
fundamental part of industrial engineering. But I've also become interested in
statistics from more of a mathematical point of view.
Taking a full year of probability-centric courses should help with that.
I'll also get my fair share of studying applied statistics, so I'm hoping this
year will scratch my statistics itch and also prepare me for statistical modelling
and data analysis in my future.</p>
<h3>Also, forest fires</h3>
<p>Oh yeah, I'm also signed up to take a course in forest fire management.</p>
<p>That'll be fun.</p>
<h1>Open Source Aspirations</h1>
<p>This month is a bit of a milestone, marking my third anniversary of starting to
get into programming and the world of computer science in general. I'm quite
confident in my abilities with using computers to solve problems, but I still
feel like I have a long way to go in terms of being comfortable with software
development.</p>
<p>Contributing to open-source software has been an aspiration of mine since I
started my second year of programming, but I just haven't found the time or
the confidence to jump into it. I'm hoping that this will be my year to start.
I see working on open-source projects as a way to keep my programming in
practice, work on my software development skills, and explore topics I actually
find interesting. I realize that a lot of people have trouble getting started
contributing to open source, and I suffer from the same kind of fear of doing
a bad job. It's just something I'll have to get over.</p>
<h1>Languages</h1>
<p>My goal was to be reasonable proficient in French and Spanish by the end of
the year.
It looks like I'm on track to miss both of those marks, but that's no reason
not to keep trying for proficiency in the languages I want to be proficient at.
I think I need to stop worrying about working on my reading and writing, and
instead put Radio-Canada on 24/7.
My plan is to put 90% of my effort into spoken language, because that's
really where most of my deficiencies are right now.</p>
<p>Either way, I'm hoping 2017 will the
The Year of Being Actually Passable in French and Spanish.</p>
<h1>More blog posts!</h1>
<p>It'd be embarassing if this ends up being the last blog post I make for the next
6 months.
But I'm liking the idea of doing blog updates to summarize what I've been working
on and what I've been interested in.
It's a good way to organize my thoughts and also practe my writing.</p>
<p>I still won't have a hard and fast rule for what I'll be writing about. But from
where I'm standing, it looks like it'll be more data analysis and economics,
with some new content on software development and related topics.
Hopefully, those will be coming out at a faster pace than they have been.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>So, that's a wrap! I have a lot I want to get done this year, and I'd be happy
if I got just half of it done. Expect more blog posts, but don't be too upset
if they keep taking a while. I'm still trying to understand this whole blogging
thing.</p>                </article>
