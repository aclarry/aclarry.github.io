</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Of all the courses I'm taking this fall at UofT, I'm enjoying my fourth year applied
statistics course the most. As its name suggests, it focuses on real-world applications,
mostly the details of statistical models and stuff to do with p-values. To do these things,
we've explored some probability distributions that I haven't seen before, like the
noncentral chi-square distribution.</p>
<p>This musing on different distributions brought me to a thought: the normal distribution is
important in statistics because of the central limit theorem. But we value the limiting
behaviour of the sums of random variables kind of arbitrarily. So my question was:
is there a similar limiting behaviour around the products of random variables?
In my mind, there must be at least as many situations where you're looking at
the product of a bunch of random events are you are where you're looking at
the sum of a bunch of random events. But in 3 years of stats courses and reading, I
haven't come across it!</p>
<p>So, I went about looking into this, and what I found is pretty cool! Note: I started
out exploring this by simulating a bunch of distributions. Later on, I found out that
the distribution is actually pretty well known and does get used in places. I'll talk
about this at the end, but don't take that as an opportunity to ignore the first bit!</p>
