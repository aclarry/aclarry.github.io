</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>As I said in my last post, I've wanted to get better at software development,
and contributing to open source software seems to be a great way to get experience.
Unfortunately, as many before me have pointed out, getting into open source is scary.
Not only are the projects themselves intimidating (there's just so much code to take in!),
but there's the fear that somehow I'm going to end up wasting other developers' time.</p>
<p>I want to get over this fear, so I realized pretty early on that I just had to jump
into something. Of course, that immediately led me to analysis paralysis -
I had all sorts of choices to make about the project I would jump into.
Should it be new, with a bunch of big features still needing to be implemented,
or should it be more mature with a large contributor base?
What problems should it be solving?
What kind of problems to I want to solve in contributing (networking,
numerical analysis, documentation, GUIs, etc.)?
What language should it be in? What tools should it use?</p>
<h1>Just do it</h1>
<p>I wasted way too much time in this state, about two years to be precise. 
Equal parts analysis paralysis and fear of failure kept me from really making an
effort to contribute. I was always looking for the <em>perfect</em> project, but I
never actually knew what "<em>perfect</em>" meant.</p>
<p>A month ago, I put my foot down. My work term was just wrapping up, and I had a
couple of weeks before classes started, so if I had to, I could devote an entire
month or so to the project.
I'm not sure how I did it, but I was able to pick the first open source project
I came across: the compiler for the Rust programming language.
With that, I just checked the project's main repo on github, and found a small-ish
issue that involved changing how the compiler displayed an error message.</p>
<p>Obviously, the magic here came somewhere between deciding I should work on something,
and resigning myself to not care at all about what it was I was working on.
I should probably figure out how to do that whenever I want to, but for now I'm
focused on keeping my momentum going and keeping the comfort I have in the open
source world.</p>
<h1>Actually doing work</h1>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly (to me), I ran into a few basic development issues along the
way. Somehow, I hadn't properly forked/cloned the current version of the repository,
so I only had about 1/2 of the project's code.
Of course, I wasn't well-acquainted with the Rust compiler's source, and it compiled
properly, so I wasn't sure off the bat that the problem wasn't me misunderstanding
the code base. It took me a while to clue in exactly what was wrong.
I probably should have been prepared for that, but it's an important lesson in 
always checking your assumptions.</p>
<p>On a similar note, I had some issues with building and testing my code.
The Rust compiler is pretty complex, with lots of options to configure for the
build, and what seemed to be two ways to actually build the project (a complex
system of makefiles, and a custom python script).
I got pretty lost, and I ended up hitting one bug that I think could have been
solved much faster if I knew exactly what the build system and tests were doing.
I don't know if this was a failure on my part or the project's (or if it's
just an inevitable result of having such a complex project), but I'd like to
try to understand Rust's buid system better, and explore how other large-ish
projects get buit, too.</p>
<p>I was pretty happy with the exposure I got to working with git. I try to use
git for basically any project I have that's anything more than a throwaway script,
but I had never used git in a particularly intelligent way. To get my changes
done in a clean way, there was a lot of rebasing, squashing commits, and force
updating my pull request. It wasn't anything that I hadn't seen before, but
using those parts of git on a real life project made them a lot more tangible to me.</p>
<h1>Rust in particular</h1>
<p>This undertaking wasn't really about Rust, and this post isn't supposed to be about
Rust either. That said, I feel the need to comment on it, given this was my first
real bit of Rust that I wrote. Even though I didn't write particularly complex code,
I had to work to make myself understand Rust's type system and borrow checker.
That said, from the exposure I've gotten, I really see how Rust makes up for
deficiencies in C and C++, the main incumbent languages that it's trying to compete with. </p>
<p>While I realize that I will need to understand C and C++ pretty well if I want to
go anywhere in systems-type programming, I hope that I can do some more work with
Rust. It has some interesting ideas and I could see myself really enjoying programming
in it!</p>
<h1>Things learned</h1>
<p>So, I learned some pretty important things from this little adventure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don't need to be a programming genius to get into open source development.
  Every project has little things that need to be cleaned up, or little
  bugs that need to be fixed. Big projects may seem scarier, but I get the sense that
  they have more resources to accomodate new contributors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm actually reasonably competent at working on software and understanding big projects!
  It might have taken me more time to finish my little contribution than a seasoned
  Rust contributor would have, but I made it through in a couple weeks of working on it
  (very) part time. Nobody laughed me to death, and I got to actually get a contribution
  merged into a project that tonnes of people use!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of just sitting down and doing something. I am blessed/cursed with
  having a billion little thoughts floating in my head, along with a desire to do
  stuff that's useful to other people.
  But I am soooo bad at actually working on any of that, which I think is a combination
  of the aforementioned analysis paralysis, and an adversion to actually finishing things.
  Like I said, I don't know what the actual solution to this is - it just kind of
  magically worked out this time - but it's so important. My plan at the moment is
  to hope that practice makes perfect, and try to make room for a bunch more little
  projects over the next year or so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to wrap up, contributing to open source is way less scary than I thought,
and if you enjoy the Rust compiler's error message for E0560
(trying to initialize a struct with fields it doesn't have), you can partially thank me!</p>                </article>
